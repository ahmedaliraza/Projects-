<div id="panel1">
  <blockquote><b>"The CyberKnife System is a radiation therapy device manufactured by Accuray Incorporated. The system is used for treating benign tumors, malignant tumors and other medical conditions. This device combines a lightweight linear accelerator mounted on a robotic manipulator and an integrated image guidance system. The image guidance system continually acquires stereoscopic kV images during treatment, tracks tumor motion, and guide the robotic manipulator to precisely and accurately align the treatment beam to the moving tumor. The system is designed for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The system is also used for select 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The CyberKnife System is designed to deliver radiotherapy more accurately than standard radiotherapy devices".</b></blockquote>
<h2>Gamma-Knife(Radiosurgery):</h2>
    <blockquote><b>"Radiosurgery is surgery using radiation, that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of tissue using ionizing radiation rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of radiation therapy, it is usually used to treat cancer. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as "a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest". In stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), the word "stereotactic" refers to a three-dimensional coordinate system that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient".</b></blockquote>

<div id="flip"><h3>Q:How Does Cyber-Knife Works?</h3></div>
<div id="panel2"><ul>Answer:<p>CyberKnife uses an advanced, lightweight linear accelerator (LINAC), mounted on a robotic arm, to deliver an intense focused dose of radiation to the targeted tumor.  Hundreds of these tiny, high-energy radiation “beamlets” are delivered from multiple directions.  Each beamlet by itself delivers a minuscule amount of radiation.  They intersect only on the tumor, where the dose from the beams adds up to deliver the intense focused radiation. Using x-ray -guided cameras, the CyberKnife system locates the exact position of the tumor with surgical precision.

The robotic delivery system integrates motion-tracking software, called the Synchrony System, making it accurate enough to treat a moving target. When a patient breathes or moves during treatment, the robot detects the motion and compensates in 'real time,' ensuring that the radiation is accurately hitting the target with sub-millimeter precision. 

With the maneuverability of the robotic arm, surgeons can administer multiple radiation beams from up to 1,200 different targeting positions and angles. All of the beams intersect within the tumor where the total dose is high enough to obliterate the cancer, while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.

<div id="flip" style="background-color: lightgrey"><h3>Q:How is Cyber-Knife used to treat Prostate Cancer?</h3></div>
<div id="panel3"><ul>Answer:<p>CyberKnife® is targeted, high-dose radiation administered to the cancerous prostate tumour over a series of 1-5 sessions and days. Patients are awake during each 30-90 minute treatment. The radiation used in CyberKnife® treatments is referred to as Stereoactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and is recommended for men diagnosed with low to moderate risk prostate cancer.

CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery System proves more efficient than ordinary radiation therapy due to a more accurate targeting of the prostate and corrections regarding its movement. Common radiation therapy cannot trace the movement of the prostate during treatment, causing healthy surrounding areas to be affected by the radiation.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div id="flip" style="background-color: #FF1493"><h3>Q:What are the specific steps of the CyberKnife treatment?</h3></div>
<div id="panel4"><p><ul>Answer:
<li>The doctors will require a PSA level test that will provide a basis for interpreting the results of the treatment.</li>
<li>The doctor will insert fiducial markers into the prostate, through an ultrasound guided needle. This will help the CyberKnife® System with locating the exact position of the prostate along the treatment.</li>
<li>The patient will undergo a CT scan that will detect the exact size, location and shape of the prostate and, if necessary, a MRI scan to fully visualize the prostate and its environment. During the scanning and the treatment, the patient will lay on a custom moulded cradle that will enable him to maintain the same position during the entire time.</li>
<li>Consulting the CT scan and MRI results, the medical physicist and the patient’s doctors will devise a treatment plan with optimal radiation delivery.</li>
<li>The treatment will entail that the patient stays still on their custom body cradle. The CyberKnife system's Computer-controlled robot will trace the position of the prostate and move around the patient's body to administer precise radiation.</li>
<li>After the session is complete, the patient can go about their day in a normal way and return for additional treatment as indicated by their doctor.</li>
<li>Upon completion of the treatment, the patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointments and have PSA level tests and digital rectal exams as indicated by the doctor.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div id="flip" style="background-color: lightgrey"><h3>Q:What are the Advantages of Cyber-Knife Treatment?</h3></div>
<div id="panel5"><ul>Answer:<p>
<li>The side effects of CyberKnife® treatment are minimal and can include:  burning sensation during urination, low urinary stream, more frequent urination and stools, stools incontinence and more gas during bowel movements.</li>
<li>Lower duration of treatment: four to five days as opposed to over 35 days as is the case with regular radiation therapy.</li>
<li>Accidental radiation of healthy surrounding areas is massively reduced: the CyberKnife has sub-milimeter clinical accuracy.</li>
<li>Minimum to zero recovery time required.</li>
<li>Often the most appropriate treatment for inoperable or untreatable tumors.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div id="flip" style="background-color: #FF1493"><h3>Q:What are the Disadvantages of Cyber-Knife Treatment?</h3></div>
<div id="panel6"><ul>Answer:<p>
<li>
Radiosurgery and radiation are “best guess” treatments that attempt to address all cancerous prostate cells. During CyberKnife® therapy, radiation is directed at the cancerous prostate based on pre-treatment biopsy and CT scan data. Imaging information gathered before and during the procedure is used to approximate the radiation dosage based on the location, size, and shape of the tumor.</li>
<li>However, pre-surgery prostate cancer data is not always accurate. Due to limitations in prostate cancer staging diagnostics, the true nature and scope of a man’s tumor is not known until it is visualized during surgery. In these post-surgery tests we learn the exact type of prostate cancer, how extensive it is, as well as the status of the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. Research shows that prostate cancer tumor staging actually changes in as many as 40% of men after post-surgery lab testing.</li>
<li>Men who choose CyberKnife® radiation will be left with a fluctuating PSA level and non-specific tumor results. After CyberKnife® therapy the tumor can take months or years to disappear, or it may remain in the body permanently with stalled growth. A rigorous follow-up schedule must be maintained to monitor PSA level and tumor status for life. While the hope is that the cancer will not return, the testing and worry can be very draining.</li>
<li>According to CyberKnife research, 84% of patients chose the treatment method because of their comfort with the expected risks and side effects, but only 59% of men believed the procedure was the most likely to eliminate their prostate cancer.</li>
<li>Often the most appropriate treatment for inoperable or untreatable tumors.</li>
</ul>

<div id="flip" style="background-color: lightgrey"><h3>Q:How does CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery Differ from Robotic Prostatectomy Surgery and Radiation?</h3></div>
<div id="panel7"><ul>Answer:<p>
CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery is not robot-assisted surgery; it is simply another form of prostate cancer radiation such as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy. CyberKnife® is FDA-approved radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer, though the procedure is very new.

During robotic prostatectomy surgery, Dr. Samadi uses real-time, first-hand visualization to assess the prostate cancer scope and remove the tumor. This proven, minimally invasive procedure integrates the precision and visualization of robot-assisted surgery with the expertise of Dr. Samadi’s vast surgical background. With appropriate follow-up and post-surgery care, PSA level should drop to an undetectable level after robotic prostatectomy surgery.

Radiation such as CyberKnife can be an effective secondary measure for men with high-risk, recurring prostate cancer
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div id="flip"><h3>Q:What are the Side-Effects of Cyber Knife?</h3></div>
<div id="panel8"><ul>Answer:<p>  
The negative side effects of CyberKnife can be expected to mirror those of other targeted radiation therapies.

Over the short term, radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause:
<ul>
<li>Urination problems including burning and blood in the urine</li>
<li>Urinary urgency and frequency</li>
<li>Weakened urinary stream</li>
<li>Incomplete emptying of the bladder</li>
<li>Anal and rectal irritation, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and stool problems</li>
<li>Fatigue and nausea</li>
</ul>
Long-term CyberKnife and prostate cancer radiation side effects may include:
<ul>
<li>Sexual impotence and/or erectile dysfunction for up to 2 years after treatment</li>
<li>Delayed orgasm or ejaculation</li>
<li>Temporary or permanent reduction in sperm count; fertility should be discussed with your physician prior to CyberKnife® treatment</li>
<li>Impaired bowel function</li>
<li>Potential increased risk of bladder or rectal cancer by 5%</li>
</ul>
