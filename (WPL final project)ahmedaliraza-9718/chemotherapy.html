  <blockquote><b>"Chemotherapy (chemo) is a type of treatment that includes a medication or combination of medications to treat cancer. The goal of chemo is to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. Chemo is considered a systemic therapy. This means it may affect your entire body. Chemo medications attack rapidly growing cancer cells, but they can also affect healthy cells that grow rapidly. The effect of these medications on normal cells often causes chemo side effects".</b>

<div id="flip"><h3>Q:How Chemo Works?</h3></div>
<div id="panel61"><ul>Answer:
  
<li>The goal of chemotherapy (chemo) is to kill cancer cells or slow cancer's growth over time. Chemo is often given several times over weeks or months in what is known as a course of treatment. A course of treatment is made up of a series of treatment periods, called cycles. During a cycle, you may get chemo every day for one or more days. Since chemo also kills normal cells, these chemo days are followed by periods of rest when you receive no treatment. This rest lets your body recover and produce new healthy cells.
</li><img src="http://www.chemotherapy.com/images/chemo_schedule.gif " align="right">
<br>
<p>Your Chemo Regimen: Your doctor will create a plan, or regimen, that includes the type of chemo medications you will receive. The regimen also includes the medication dose and how often you will receive it. Your doctor will choose certain medications that can best fight your cancer. You may also receive medications that help support your body's ability to better tolerate the chemo from start to finish. Talk to your doctor and care team about what you can do to help you meet your treatment goals.</p></ul>
</div>
<br>


<div id="flip" style="background-color:#FF1493"><h3>Q:How Chemotherapy is given:?</h3></div>
<div id="panel62"><ul>Answer:
<p>Chemotherapy (chemo) treatment plans may use a single medication or a combination (or "cocktail") of medications that can be delivered in more than one way. You may receive chemo in one or more of the following forms:</p>


<li>Injection. Types of injection include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Subcutaneous (SQ): Chemo given as a shot just under the skin</li>
<li>Intramuscular (IM): Chemo given as a shot directly into a muscle</li>
<li>Intravenous (IV): Chemo given as a shot directly into a vein</li>
<li>IV infusion: Chemo medications are dripped through a tube that is attached to a needle and put into a vein</li>
<li>Oral: Chemo taken by mouth as a pill or liquid.</li>
<li>Topical: A cream containing the chemo medication that is rubbed into the skin</li>
<li>Intra-arterial (IA): Chemo delivered into an artery that is connected to the tumor</li>
<li>Intraperitoneal (IP): Chemo given directly into the area that contains the intestines, stomach, liver, ovaries, etc. This area is called the peritoneal cavity.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>




<div id="flip" style="background-color: lightgrey"><h3>Q:Chemotherapy treatment Goals:?</h3></div>
<div id="panel63"><ul>Answer:
<p>The goals of chemotherapy (chemo) may vary by each person's situation. You may be starting chemo for one of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To cure the cancer: When possible, chemo is used to eliminate cancer cells until they are no longer detected in your body.</li>
<li>To control the cancer: Chemo may be used to keep cancer from spreading, slow its growth, or destroy cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body.</li>
<li>To ease cancer symptoms (sometimes called palliation): When cancer is in the advanced stage, chemo may be used to shrink cancer tumors that are causing pain or pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemo given after surgery or radiation is called adjuvant chemotherapy. The goal of adjuvant therapy is to kill any cancer cells left in the body after surgery or radiation therapy. Chemo given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The goal of neoadjuvant therapy may be to shrink the cancer tumor to make it easier to be removed surgically.

<div id="flip"><h3>Q:Treatment Example:</h3></div>
<div id="panel64"><ul>Answer:
<blockquote>"Mariana had a tumor removed from her breast. Her doctor has prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. The goal of her therapy is to cure the cancer.
Mariana's doctor makes her aware of the risks and side effects of the chemo treatment he prescribed. The chemo side effects she may have include changes to her blood cell counts, hair loss, and nausea and vomiting.
Mariana asks her doctor and care team what she can do in advance to prepare for these chemo side effects. She explains that she wants to do what she can to manage chemo side effects.<br>
<img src="http://www.chemotherapy.com/images/Mariana1.png" align="center"><br>

Mariana's doctor gives her details about what she can do to manage her chemo side effects, such as how to help prevent infection and manage fatigue and nausea. She gets a list of instructions about what she should eat and drink during her course of chemo. She speaks with a social worker about getting a wig".</blockquote>
